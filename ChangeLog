version 0.18
	* Fixed various bugs and memory leaks.

version 0.17
	* The length of layer 1 (MP1) frames are now correctly calculated,
	  making Checkmate also work with MP1 files.
	* The CRC of layer 2 (MP2) files are now correct. Thanks to Andrew
	  Kuklewicz for the reporting of this bug.

version 0.16
	* MP3 checker does not crash anymore when files or directories start
	  with non-ASCII characters

version 0.15
	* Directories are not checked for extension, so that the recursive
	  scanning works better. Thanks to Geert-Jan de Laat.
	* Don't crash when the file ends with letters which identify an
	  ID3 tag. Thanks to Kevin Williams.

version 0.14
	* Consistency is now checked in reference to the previous frame,
	  instead of the first frame. This solves some false "No MP3 file"
	  reports.

version 0.12
	* Major cleanup of mpck.
	* Removed some bugs which caused false positives.

version 0.11
	* Renamed package with wimpck and mpck to Checkmate.
	* Renamed wimpck to Checkmate MP3 checker.

version 0.10
	* Millisecond timing precision
	* Does not crash when a file can not be read

version 0.09
	* Exit status now makes sense
	* CRC now works for all versions

version 0.08
	* improved error messages
	* fixed CRC (may not work for all layers/versions)
	* added --namecheck flag, which checks for strange characters in
	  filenames

version 0.07
	* added average bitrate statistic
	* fixed bug which made mpck crash on empty files
	* added -B switch, to report bad files only

version 0.06
	* code cleanup
	* with -b or -f (partial checking) now doesn't run check_end, hence
	  never touches the end of the file
	* implemented buffered reading

version 0.05
	* included libgnugetopt-1.2, for systems without getopt_long
	* added -m switch, to set a limit on the length of filenames
	* now checks filenames for strange characters

version 0.04
	* ported to MS Windows
	* renamed to mpck

version 0.03
	* Program searches for last frame, in order to determine where to stop
	  scanning
	* readframe does not read frames anymore; it just moves the file
	  pointer
	* program now reads CRCs, but doesn't do anything with them

version 0.02
	* Speed improvements
	* Solved some segfaults and divide by zero errors
	* Frame time and total time now work
	* Samples per frame is now correct
	* Frame length is now correct
	* Documentation updates

version 0.01 
	* Initial release
