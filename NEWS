mpck

0.10 (12-01-2005)
	It has been a while since the last release, mainly because I wanted
	to catch some bugs instead of introducing new features. As it seems
	there are not many bugs and I am happy to hear some feature requests.

0.09 (15-02-2004)
	The exit status is now meaningful. I am not sure if mpck should return
	something other than zero if it encounters a bad file. It then did
	it's job, without errors, so the exit status should be zero. However,
	for shell scripts it could be handy.

0.08 (26-11-2003)
	The way errors are reported is somewhat changed, so mpck now also prints
	what is wrong in the file. I will not introduce new features in
	mpck till 0.10, only fix bugs.

0.07 (18-11-2003)
	I tried to fork mpck for speed improvement, but it didn't work.
	Too bad. So only some small fixes in this release.

0.06 (05-10-2003)
	I have implemented buffered I/O, so that reading files is quicker. This
	is optimized for harddisk speeds, it can have a negative effect on
	network access etc.

0.05 (04-09-2003)
	I recently looked over the features of mp3check (Ryan Gordon) and I
	think it is not too hard to make mpck a replacement for mp3check.
	So I did some work on filename checking, but it is not yet
	finished.

0.04 (01-09-2003)
	These CRC codes are giving me a headache.
	I have ported mp3check to Windows and renamed it mpck, inspired by
	fsck, the file system checker utility.

0.03 (26/08/2003)
	I split checkfile in check_begin and check_end. Mp3check now first
	searches for the last frame (check_end), so that check_begin nows where
	to stop.

	GDB is cool!!! The GNU Debugger has helped out with most segfaults
	and floating point exceptions. Learn it! Use it!
	I made macro's of some functions to speed things up, but running
	mp3check on Ogg Vorbis files still take ages. ;)

0.01 (30/04/2003)
	What purpose has the NEWS file? Is the ChangeLog file not enough
	already?
