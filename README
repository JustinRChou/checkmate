Checkmate readme

--=[ DESCRIPTION ]=--

Checkmate mpck checks mp3s. It scans the file to see if the frames are
where they are supposed to be, if the frame headers are correct  and  if 
the headers are consistent throughout the file. It gives some statistics
on the file like bitrate and length, and a conclusion whether the file is
good or bad.

MP3 checker is a Microsoft Windows interface for mpck. It also scans MP3
files and has a Explorer-like display which shows which files where
scanned and what the result was. MP3 checker was tested on Windows 2000
and should work on any Windows version.

--=[ BUILDING ]=--

If your release does not have `configure`, first run

    ./autogen.sh

After that, it is the normal build method:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

For Windows there is a Visual Studio project in the `vc++` directory.

--=[ USAGE ]=--

Usage: mpck [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Verbosity:
   -v, --verbose        print some extra info
   -q, --quiet          print only Ok or Bad per file
   -B, --badonly	only report bad files
Other options:
   -R, --recursive      check directories recursively
   -e, --extention=EXT  only check files ending on .EXT
   -r			short for -R -e mp3
   -m, --maxname=NUM 	report bad for filenames which exceed NUM characters
   -n, --namecheck	check for strange characters in the filename
   -h, --help           print this help, then exit
   -V, --version        print version information

--=[ OUTPUT ]=--

Occasionally, something goes wrong and mpck prints an error. It has one
of the following formats:
1) mpck: stat on blah failed
2) mpck:bla: foo bar error
3) mpck:bla:34003: yet another error

Number 1 indicates a general error. Number 2 means an error occured in file
bla. Number 3 says an error occured in file bla, at offset 34003 (decimal).

If all is well, mpck will output something like this:

SUMMARY: mp3/test.mp3
    version                       MPEG v1.0
    layer                         3

    errors                        none
    result                        Ok

--=[ EXIT STATUS ]=--

mpck returns one of the following values:

0               Everything went OK and no broken files were found.
1               Everything went OK, but at least one broken file was found.
2 (ENOENT)      File or directory not found, stat failed.
4 (EINTR)       The program received a SIGINT.
5 (EIO)         Read error.
12 (ENOMEM)     Malloc failed due to memory shortage.
21 (EISDIR)     The given file is a directory.
22 (EINVAL)     Invalid argument, no filename supplied.
36 (ENAMETOOLONG) File extention or file name is too long.
