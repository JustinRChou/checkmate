mpck readme

--=[ DESCRIPTION ]=--

mpck reads MP3 files and tries to determine if they are correct (e.g. not
damaged). Furthermore, it displays statistics like the bitrate.
It is fast (0.6 sec per file on a my 800Mhz computer), supports recursive
checking directories and runs on both Linux and Windows.

--=[ USAGE ]=--

Usage: mpck [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Partial checking of files:
   (using these options produces inaccurate statistics)
   -b, --bytes=NUM      check only the first NUM bytes
   -f, --frames=NUM     check only the first NUM frames
Verbosity:
   -v, --verbose        print some extra info. Use twice for mega-verbosity
                        which prints info for each frame. Use with care
   -q, --quiet          print only Ok or Bad per file
   -B, --badonly        only report bad files
Other options:
   -R, --recursive      check directories recursively
   -e, --extention=EXT  only check files ending on .EXT
   -r			short for -R -e mp3
   -m, --maxname=NUM    report bad for filenames which exceed NUM characters
   -n, --namecheck      check for strange characters in the filename
   -h, --help           print this help, then exit
   -V, --version        print version information

--=[ OUTPUT ]=--

Occasionally, something goes wrong and mpck prints an error. It has one
of the following formats:
1) mpck: stat on blah failed
2) mpck:bla: foo bar error
3) mpck:bla:34003: yet another error

Number 1 indicates a general error. Number 2 means an error occured in file
bla. Number 3 says an error occured in file bla, at offset 34003 (decimal).

If all is well, mpck will output something like this:

SUMMARY: mp3/test.mp3
    version                       MPEG v1.0
    layer                         3
    bitrate                       128000 bps
    samplerate                    44100 Hz
    frames                        12232
    time                          5:19
    unidentified                  0 b
    result                        Ok

--=[ EXIT STATUS ]=--

mpck returns one of the following values:

0		Everything went OK and no broken files were found.
1		Everything went OK, but at least one broken file was found.
2 (ENOENT)	File or directory not found, stat failed.
4 (EINTR)	The program received a SIGINT.
5 (EIO)		Read error.
12 (ENOMEM)	Malloc failed due to memory shortage.
21 (EISDIR)	The given file is a directory.
22 (EINVAL)	Invalid argument, no filename supplied.
36 (ENAMETOOLONG) File extention or file name is too long.

--=[ WORDLIST ]=--

ID3V1		Specifies if a ID3v1 tag is present in the file
ID3V2		Specifies if a ID3v2 tag is present in the file
average bitrate See: bitrate, vbr
bitrate		One second of sound is stored in this many bits
frames		Number of frames in the file
layer		MPEG layer   - 1, 2 or 3.
length		The length of a frame in bytes
offset		The position in bytes from the start of the file
result		Specifies if the file is correct or damaged
samplerate	The sound is sampled this many times per second
size		Size of the file in KiB (1 KiB = 1024 bytes)
